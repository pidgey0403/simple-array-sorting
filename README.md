# simple-array-sorting
Build a 3D array based on user inputted dimensions. Populated the cells with randomly generated values, sort it into ascending order, and output the resulting structure. 

This was a student project for my Intro to C and Unix course, and was intended to serve as an introduction to programming in C, dynammically allocating memory for pointers to multi-dimensional arrays, freeing dynamic memory, and creating modular functions.
